I've not been writing here nearly as often as I would like and I've been thinking about how to change that. As I read of alot of blogs every day, it finally hit me: the ones I visit often are the ones that are brutally transparent, posts atleast once a week and keeps their posts short.
So that made me decide to change it up a little.

I've been trying to come up with post-ideas that where too big and the result have been, well, nothing...

So, from this day on, expect short, transparent posts about what changes are being worked on, and the reasoning behind it.

See it like a diary of my work on Simple Golftour. Growth hacking, code snippets, gifs of interface changes and more.
