To better explain to new visitors of the landing page how Simple Golftour works I experimented with different ways to present the [new simple flow](https://blog.simplegolftour.com/new-simple-flow-for-league-management) and after experimenting with sliders, animations and video I decided a simple list with some illustrations would do it.

I found a funny looking guy in one of my many folders of downloaded freebies. Hopefully it will make it more clear what Simple Golftour actually is and how it works.

Here it is in action:
