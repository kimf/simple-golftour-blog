#General ideas
  - My new format of blogging (see old post), did not work, I suck.

#Stuff we can blog about when done (✓):
  ✓ Public tour page on subdomain (with form screenshot), custom domain will be available soon, email me to try it out beforehand
  ✓ Manage tour members, remove, make admin.
  ✓ New choosable reversed points-system.
  - Open events with end-date
  - Self-reporting on those open events (if account with email)
  - Possibility to add players with only name and no email
  - Maybe have a "nickname" per tour
  - Edit an event after scores are in (maila Kim Lidberg)

#Write about all this stuff, then send out newsletter?
Maybe with a link to the tour creators own public tour page
